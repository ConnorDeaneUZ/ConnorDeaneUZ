# Hey, I’m Connor 👋

Frontend engineer building high-performance products with Vue, Nuxt, and TypeScript.

I’m curious about programming beyond the frontend — exploring Python for machine learning, C++ for game development, and Solidity for blockchain applications. I enjoy understanding how different languages solve different classes of problems.
